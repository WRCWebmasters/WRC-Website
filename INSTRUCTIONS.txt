hello~ this is jing

*** To set up the app (first time installation)
1. run "npm i --save" in terminal
this just installs all the packages that this React app uses, you can view which ones there are in package.json

*** To run the app 
1. run "npm start"
2. view in browser using the local address given in the terminal. the browser automatically refreshes when changes are saved.
(you may have to refresh it manually to click on things tho... idk why that happens)

I left all the existing html/css in this branch (just in case you need images or something that's not in the React site), labeled
with a "_old" at the end of the folder name.

You can find the root of the project at "/src/App.js" which connects the pages together using react-router-dom. To access actual 
pages, those are found in /src/pages. The /src/components folder contains self-made components that can be re-used throughout the
site (ex. the navigation bar/header). I basically threw all of the other things that are used in /src/resources so sorry if it's kind
of hard to find things lol.
