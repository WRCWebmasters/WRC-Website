            <p> Will Rice has an extensive network of faculty, alumni, and community mentors called Associates. They
                help students find new opportunities for growth outside of campus via volunteering, field trips, and
                common interest activities. Furthermore, Associates have a chance to participate in Rice’s unique
                college system and make lasting connections with current students. If you are interested in becoming an
                Associate, please contact Dale Thomas at <a href="mailto:wrc@rice.edu">wrc@rice.edu</a>).

            <p>While growing up in Kansas, Jon thought that he would get a job working in information technology and spend the rest of his life happily sitting alone at a computer. Once he had completed a Computer Science degree from Kansas State University and several years in the IT industry, Jon realized that a future in technology without significant interaction with other people was quickly becoming his own private hell. After a short dalliance with managerial roles (and an MBA from KSU), Jon found the love of his life: teaching. He began a PhD in Organizational Behavior from Michigan State University. During his pre-PhD life, Jon held such varied roles as Comic Book Store Owner, UNIX Systems Administrator, Project Manager, and Statistics Instructor. Despite top-notch training in OB research (and much to the chagrin of his professors), Jon chose to turn away from a research-based life and pursue a career as a teaching-focused professor. He spent three years at the University of Cincinnati, creating, teaching, and managing an undergraduate course on professionalism and ethics before moving on to Rice Business in the summer of 2018. He loves creating interactive classrooms, where students work together with the instructor to teach each other and experience the material directly through personal stories and classroom exercises. </p>

Her first visit to Will Rice resulted in her getting hit in the forehead with a paper airplane, and she knew she had come to the right place. Settling in, she became a Divisional Advisor and dragged her husband, Edward, into the fray as well.  He’s a retired engineer from Exxon Mobil and has volunteered at the Houston Zoo for over 20 years, where he announces sea lion shows and is certified to present the porcupine.  Together they are avid supporters of Will Rice’s artistic and community projects.  They also supply a seven-layer dip for every semester’s Associate Study Break. </p>

            <p>Born at a young age, Bill Tanner came to Rice in 1990 and graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in '94.  In order to avoid the real world a bit longer, he stuck around to earn his Masters in Mechanical Engineering in '95.  During his time at Rice he was involved in the Cascade Juggling Club, KTRU, the Mob, and the Rice Players (among other things).  He always meant to do a comic strip for the Thresher, but settled on doing t-shirt designs and even came up with the 90's re-design of Sammy the Owl.  He currently works at Schlumberger as a Solution Architect and enjoys drawing, playing ukulele, and spending time with his family in his spare time.  He was lucky enough to meet his wife Jean (Hanszen '88) after they both had been out of Rice for a while, so they're doing their part to prop up that particular myth.    </p>

            <p>I'm a proud WRC alum from the Class of 2001.  I loved my days at WRC as a student, having served as an O-week Advisor, Beer Bike Coordinator, Associates Committee member and loads more. I've come full circle because I'm now serving as an Associate and want to do so much more! Since 2009 (the same amount of years that I've been an Associate), I've been working at Baylor College of Medicine as a Physician Assistant; I see patients and teach students at Baylor. I'm always excited to chat it up with our WRCers so if you don't see me at an Associates' event, you can catch me at WRC Commons when I take a break from my jogs at 5:30 AM on weekdays (YIKES!) or weekends before 10:00 AM.  WRWS! </p>

            <p>I am a proud Will Rice Alum, class of 2012! I served as an RHA for two years and the Chief Justice my senior year. I founded Karma Patrol along with a great team of WRC RHA's. After graduating, I jumped into Teach for America and now work in education tech, designing software that helps care coordinators connect students to holistic supports. You can always find me watching “Friends” reruns or debating with myself on whether I'll make it to the gym to swim laps. I usually end up watching “Friends” reruns.</p>

            <p>
                Gilbert Cuthbertson was a legendary Will Rice RA, aka Doc C. First of all, Doc was an amazing storyteller, and he had a story for every occasion. Most of his stories were about former Will Rice students - that’s because he was involved for more than 50 years! His favorite activities included hunting down bargains, buying things on eBay, being the WRC legendary card shark (bridge and liar’s poker are his personal favorites), teaching his outstanding and entertaining political science classes, schooling freshmen in the gameroom, and greeting Will Rice students with a warm smile and emphatic “No problem!”. You can’t help but be entertained by some of the stories he has to share. Doc was the most pro-Rice and pro-Will Rice person you could meet.
