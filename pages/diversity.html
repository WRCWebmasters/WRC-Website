                Hi! I’m Alexus Lee, your DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) Representative at Will Rice. 
                I’m a sophomore studying Economics and Neuroscience from NYC. 
                My role is to help make Will Rice a welcoming space for all identities. 
                We host inclusive events like Lunar New Year dumpling-making, Black History Month seafood boils, and Diwali with Lovett. 
                Will Rice also supports affinity groups for LGBTQ+, FGLI, Black, Latinx, Jewish students, and more. 
                Beyond our college, you can explore 100+ cultural orgs on OwlNest. Please reach out if you have any questions or ideas!

        <h2>Community Facilitators</h2>
        <div class="row content">
            <div id="df-text">
                Say hello to your Community facilitators TKTK from Will Rice and TKTK! We aim to make Will Rice a safe space for all identities and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. DEI is important to us because people have many intersecting identities and we want to be sure that everyone can feel part of the WIll Rice family. Community facilitators host dialogues on diversity every Friday during the school year and are a resource for finding affinity groups or clubs. We also work out conflicts that may occur where certain actions or statements threaten our culture of care. 
                <br /><br />
                What are Community facilitators? Community Facilitators, or CF’s for short, are the liaisons between the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the student body. Each residential college has at least two CF’s assigned to it, where they take charge in leading diversity and inclusion workshops during O-Week and throughout the school year, serving as advisors for college leaderships, A-teams, and peers on issues related to equity and inclusion. In addition, CF’s host weekly dialogues on diversity related topics and have a lunch open to the entire campus. 
                <br /><br />

        <h2>Commitment to Diversity</h2>
        <div class="row content">

                Dehumanization, marginalization, and violence impact so many different
                communities. At Will Rice, we stand against all types of discriminatory
                attitudes and behaviors. From Black Lives Matter to reproductive rights,
                Will Ricers engage civically and socially to strengthen our community
                bonds and uplift one another.
                <br /><br />
                We must hear the voices of our systemically disenfranchised students,
                practice empathy, and do anything in our power to support them.
                We must not speak over them but should elevate their voices, their stories,
                and their priorities. Like the Phoenix, we must rise up and evolve to be a
                more anti-racist and inclusive Will Rice. People are not a monolith.
                We aim to advocate for all people of diverse backgrounds.
