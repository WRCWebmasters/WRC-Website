        <p>
                Will Rice is made up of three separate buildings: the Commons, Old
                Dorm, and New Dorm. Commons is every Will Ricer's home base; whether it is 2 am or 3 pm, you can 
                always come to Commons to study, play a board game, or just chat with friends. With our bustling
                Commons culture, Will Ricers of all years come together in one big community!

        <h2>Old Dorm</h2>
        <h3> Dorms</h3>
        <p>Old Dorm, built in 1916, is the most historic residential building on campus! Inside, there are singles, doubles, triples, and even a couple
                quad rooms. Typically, the singles are reserved for upperclassmen. If the last two digits of your room number are 29 or less,
                you will be living in Old Dorm!

                Suites, typically populated by upperclassmen, have a common room connecting either 4 or 2 double rooms. 
                Suites have one bathroom for every two doubles, whereas New Dorm doubles contain their own bathroom. If the last two
