                            <p>If you take a little wander through South Campus--the most historic
                                portion of Rice University's campus-you'll come across a college
                                that shines like the pyre of a thousand phoenixes illuminated by myth,
                                power, and value. Congratulations, you have discovered the rust and
                                gold glory that is Will Rice College, the College of Gods and
                                Goddesses" and the second college founded at Rice University. You may
                                first notice that we have a dazzling quad, a quad flanked on three
                                sides by a spectacular newer dorm of mighty concrete, a stunning
                                historic old dorm of indestructibly epic architecture, and a cozy
                                commons of much communal merriment. It's hard to not be impressed by
                                our college's stature, even before you begin to interact with the Gods
                                and Goddesses who call Will Rice their home.</p>


                            <p>We Will Ricers have a common goal in mind--winning. Winning is our
                                religion and Beer Bike is our Christmas--we are the only college to
                                have ever swept Beer Bike (meaning that we've placed first in all
                                three races), not once, but FIVE times. Even when we don't win, we
                                take pride in putting our best effort forward and striving to be the
                                best versions of ourselves. We also win at intramural sports on almost
                                a weekly basis. As you see, we have a reputation of, well, dominating,
                                which explains why everyone tends to hate on us as a college. But
                                honestly, you can't blame us for being proud. At our core, we are a
                                friendly family of a residential college that comes together through
                                sharing our daily academic enlightenment, intramural sports, parties,
                                weekly quad celebrations, festive meetings, and of course, by simply
                                hanging out in the commons, enjoying each other's company, eating the
                                delicious bounty of East Servery, and talking about our latest plans
                                to manifest our passions.</p>

                            <p>We're damn proud of our tradition of excellence. Welcome to Will Rice.</p>
