    <h2><u>General Traditions</u></h2>

    <h3>Albert Patrick College</h3>
    <p>Unlike "Newer Dorm", the now nonexistent New Dorm mirrored Hanszen's New Dorm and had a group of rooms that faced
        the grove instead of the quad. Every year, in protest of this injustice, the 80s and 90s (the rooms in Newer
        Dorm were referred to by their room number, which corresponded with their respective staircases) would secede
        from Will Rice College during changeover and form Albert Patrick College (Albert Patrick was one of the main
        evil conspirators involved in the murder of William Marsh Rice). They would rope off an area of the commons for
        themselves and not allow others to sit there. I can only speak from the experience of my freshmen year, but we
        also voted APC citizens into faux-office, and everyday our secretaries gave announcements after the Will Rice
        secretaries did. After a week or so of this, APC threw a party in order to symbolize/celebrate their rejoining
        Will Rice. With Newer Dorm however, everyone faces the quad. Therefore, no one is indignant enough to secede so
        the tradition lays dormant... will Albert Patrick rise again?</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>WRC Classy Thursdays</h3>
    <p>So we're the best college, and we're all about knowing it and showing it. So, every Thursday, Will Rice faces up
        to the status quo of Rice University to <em>not</em> care about your appearance. We're a chill university of
        students that tend to care more about our problem sets than our wardrobe problems. So, for one day a week, Will
        Rice challenges that status quo as community, and we get classy. Every member of the college is encouraged to
        dress up for the day on Thursday in order to celebrate the coming of the weekend.</p>
    <p>How dressed up? Pretend you're going on a date. That varies from person to person, but no matter what, Will
        Ricers will be dressing to be impressing. Will Rice girls can use the opportunity express their style wearing
        whatever they can to take a break from sweats and instead look even prettier than they already are: wear
        skirts/cute shoes/blouses, do your hair, do some makeup, have fun with it! You can go all out if you want to, or
        you can just take it easy and throw on a sundress for the day.</p>
    <p>As for the guys, you should look nice, too. Whether you're just going to wear a nice shirt over solid jeans, or
        throw on a collared shirt for the day over some cargo shorts, or maybe you'd like to go all out and sport a
        half-suit, your options are limitless, too. Just take some pride in your appearance for the day!</p>
    <p>Thursdays are the day that Will Ricers show how much better looking we are than the rest of the university. Who
        knows&mdash;maybe you'll get to eat some classy dinners and win prizes for looking gorgeous. Will Rice Will Be
        Classy!!!</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Keg in the Quad</h3>
    <p>Fun in the Quad, also called Keg in Quad by some, is a great time for you to meet new people from your own
        college. Although other colleges may do similar things, it has become more of a Will Rice tradition. Almost
        every Friday afternoon, the college gets together in our quad to just hang out, talk, and wind down from the
        hard week. It's a way to vent about whatever papers or midterms you might have had that week and to also start
        thinking about the weekend. Usually their will be music playing from the old dorm kitchen and there will be lots
        and lots of random junk food. As mentioned in the name, there is often a keg for those who are of age. But if
        you're craving some soda or you're maybe just not 21 yet, there is always something for you to drink. Keg in the
        Quad definitely helps form a tight-nit community at Will Rice and is one of the many reasons why we are such a
        great college.</p>

    <h3>Game Room Challenge Ladder</h3>
    <p>Whether we are playing soccer, basketball, flag football, Powderpuff, or really any intramural sport, we are
        always competitive. And our competitiveness doesn't stop there or with Beer Bike either. For many Will Ricers
        the game room is a second home as there is almost always someone playing ping-pong, foosball, billiards, or on
        the Will Rice Arcade. Being as competitive as we are, we have created ladders for singles and doubles foosball,
        ping-pong, and pool. The ladders for each one work the same. To first get on the ladder you must challenge the
        person who is at the bottom of the ladder. If you win you get on the ladder and can continue to work your way to
        the top where you will achieve ultimate glory and will be feared by everyone else. If you lose, don't worry&mdash;you
        can always challenge again after a few days. If you ever want to practice your Doc shot, French Guillotine shot,
        or Crab Nebula defense, there most surely will always be someone in the game room to play with.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3> Phoenix Might </h3>
    <p>While most residential colleges only have crests, Will Ricers can proudly claim to have both a crest and a mascot
        in our beloved phoenix. Although a mere surveyor of Will Rice culture might mistake the phoenix to serve only as
        a rallying point, the value (or rather, the myth, power, and value) of the Will Rice phoenix goes far beyond a
        simple symbol.</p>
    <p>In Greek mythology, when a phoenix would reach the end of its life, instead of dying, it would seize up in flames
        and then be reborn of its own ashes. As college students, Will Ricers are continually undergoing the change from
        adolescence to adulthood. It is not exactly dying and being reborn, but getting through college can at times be
        a trying experience. While we are all on the road to greatness, that road will have its ups and downs. No one of
        us Will Ricers is perfect, but having the value of the phoenix reminds us that no matter our mistakes, when the
        Will Rice community stands behind us, we will always have the power to rise from our own ashes and begin
        anew.</p>

    <h3>Long Hall</h3>
    <p>Located on Historic Will Rice's second floor, Long Hall has been home to some of the most ridiculous moments (and
        people) from Will Rice history. Traditionally, Long Hall is home to freshmen and seniors. The doors are always
        unlocked, and the "Long Hallers" go in and out of each other's rooms as they please. The Will Rice old dorm
        kitchen can also be considered a part of Long Hall. Music is usually playing in the kitchen or on the hall at
        all hours of the day. If you want a quiet place to study, stay far away from second floor long! Long Hall is
        also a great place to get together with your friends. Long Hall usually throws some kind of party or get
        together on the weekends, whether dance parties, movie nights, video games, or other shenanigans. If you are
        looking for a good time, head over to Long Hall!</p>

    <h2><u>Meal Times</u></h2>

    <!-- Friday's Game and Music -->

    <h3>Lunch Announcements</h3>
    <p>Will Rice lunch is very unique. Every weekday during lunchtime, the Will Rice secretaries tell the college all
        the happenings in the college and on campus. It is a great time to get together as a community. In addition,
        lunch is a great time to count down the days till Beer Bike, Will Rice's favorite time of the year!</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Post-Meal Hours</h3>
    <p>Will Ricers value our meal times in the commons together. It's certainly a tradition to eat as many meals in our
        commons with everyone else in the college&mdash;this is the time to catch up and bond casually as a community.
        In fact, long after the last of the delicious East Servery crepe desserts have been devoured, Will Ricers will
        continue their passionate conversations for hours at the tables in the commons, especially after dinnertime.
        These colorful, connecting conversations will be some of your best memories from Rice&mdash;never hesitate to
        join in on them!</p>
    <p>NOTE: Sometimes, Will Ricers will become so attached to the tables, chairs, and discussions that ensue post-meal
        time that they'll take bets on who will be the last person to get up from the table. Sometimes, Will Ricers will
        have to deal with silly negative consequences as a result&mdash;ask Brynnan Webster and Danielle Spence about
        what happened their freshman year when their table refused to get out of their chairs...</p>
    <br/>
    <h2><u>Winning</u></h2>

    <h3>Beer Bike Sweeping/Excellence</h3>
    <p>Look anywhere else on this website and it becomes clear that Beer Bike IS Will Rice&mdash;we've swept five times,
        and every year, we strive toward the taste of sweet sweepery. Even when we don't quite sweep, we win at <em>least</em>
        one (usually two) of the races.</p>
    <p>Other colleges get mad/get jealous/get annoyed at us for caring so much about Beer Bike. But there's a deeper
        reason behind our care for Beer Bike, that being what it symbolizes: the pursuit of excellence. How can you be a
        stellar person if you don't strive to be your best? If a community believes it is the best, it'll strive to be
        the best, and then, it'll deliver&mdash;this is one of our college's core philosophies, and it manifests in
        Myth, Power, and Value. We train for weeks, sometimes <em>months</em>, before Beer Bike so that we can be great
        and feel the deep-seated satisfaction inherent in putting forth one's best effort.</p>
    <p>Other colleges <em>say</em> they're the best, but we're the only ones who SHOW we are the best. Beer Bike becomes
        our manifestation of excellence as a college. Will Rice Will Sweep!!!</p>

    <h3>Table Dancing</h3>
    <p>You will notice that at every Rice party, there will be kids dancing on tables. But these are no ordinary college
        students because&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;the kids who <em>always</em> start up the table dancing are none
        other than the ballin' Will Ricers. From the first moments of O-Week, Will Rice freshmen and advisors alike show
        our dominance above the other colleges during dance parties. As the year continues during the weekends, Will
        Ricers have fun dancing above inferior colleges on sky-high tables. Even during casual lunch times <em>and</em>
        during dinnertime festivities of college night celebrations, Will Ricers all win at table dancing. It's our
        thing across campus, and we own it.</p>
