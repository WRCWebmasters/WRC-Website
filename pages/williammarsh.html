                        <div class="people">

                            <p>In 1900, William Marsh Rice meant to
                                establish Rice University in his namesake following his death. Then,
                                Willy was poisoned by Albert Patrick, his evil conspiring butler who
                                planned to steal Willy's multimillion-dollar fortune, procured, of
                                course, from being a successful industrial revolution businessman. The
                                evil Albert Patrick even forged a fake will that deeded Willy's
                                fortune to Albert Patrick as the beneficiary. Oh no!</p>

                            <p>But, with the expert help of James A. Baker (Willy's buddy-bro from
                                work) and William M. Rice Jr. (Willy's nephew, Will Rice!) the true
                                will was resurfaced and carried out, and Mr.
                                Patrick was sentenced to death. After many years, the money that
                                Albert Patrick tried to steal went toward its original purpose: to
                                establish the best university in the country, Rice University, in the
                                year 1912.</p>

                            <p>Seriously. You can't make this stuff up. It's straight out of a
                                Western. And if you've ever been on a tour of Rice University, you know
                                this story.</p>

                            <p>Anyway, in the late 50s, Rice University decided that the residential
                                college system would be an amazing idea to implement on its grounds.
                                So, James A. Baker donated a boatload of money to establish Baker
                                College. No one really cared about that.</p>

                            <p>It was the year 1957, and by this time, Will Rice was already super
                                wealthy because he had been involved in the lumber business as well as
                                being a founder of the Union Bank and Trust Company, president of the
                                merchants and Planters Oil Company, and director of the Guardian Trust
                                and Company. Basically, he was smart, sophisticated,
                                accomplished, and a wealthy-as-hell baller. And what do wealthy people
                                do with their tons of monies? They become philanthropists.</p>

                            <p>And what better way to spend his money than to establish a residential
                                college of his very own, at the very educational institution that Will
                                Rice's uncle established, especially when Will Rice even served on the
                                Rice University Board of Trustees?</p>

                            <p>Then Will Rice he said "Let there be Will Rice College!" and he wrote
                                a check for some tens of thousands of dollars-because back then,
                                that's all you really needed to establish any given institution.</p>

                            <p>And then lesser colleges were established by lesser benefactors. No
                                need to go into detail.</p>
