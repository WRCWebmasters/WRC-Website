            <h2> Matt and Rebekah </h2>
            <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu"><h4>Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                We are Matthew and Rebekah Bennett, Magisters of Will Rice
                College. Will Rice College is a unique place within a unique
                university. It will be your home for the next four years and a
                central part of your life at the university.
            <br><br>
                Our roles as Magisters: The most formal instruction we
                ever received for being Magisters was: “Just be there.” That
                means we live with you (or rather in a house next to your
                dorms), eat with you in the commons, root you on at events
                (Beer Bike!), applaud your accomplishments, give you
                advice, challenge you academically, play foosball with you,
                champion your future, and become your friends. We’ll be
                there for the good times and bad, and will strive to make
                your time here enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling. As
                Magisters, we are the heads of the college – but don’t let
                that fool you. You, the students, are the true leaders of the
                college and you will shape it as much as it shapes you. We
                see our role as being primarily advisory – helping to steer
                the college to achieve its goals and maintain its tradition of excellence.
            <br><br>
                About us: Both of us are originally from Michigan, but have
                lived all over the country before settling in Houston in 2009
                when Matt joined the Rice faculty. We have two children,
                Jacob and Marisol, and two cats, Sasha and
                Phoenix. Rebekah, who attended Emory University and
                Georgetown Law School, is a lawyer who specializes in labor
                & employment law and corporate political activities law. She
                is currently the General Counsel of the ExxonMobil
                Pipeline Company. Rebekah loves baking, movies, travel,
                and reading. Matt is an associate professor in the
                Department of Biosciences. He attended the University of
                Michigan and received his Ph.D. in physics from Georgia
                Tech. His research aims to develop synthetic microbes for
                medical and industrial applications. Matt, an avid Detroit
                Red Wings fan, enjoys gaming, playing cards, hiking, and
                crappy science fiction.
            <br><br>
                Our foremost goal is to help you achieve your academic and
                social goals here at the university. If we can help in any way,
                just let us know!

            <p>
                Hi! I’m Dale, and I am College Coordinator at Will Rice. I have been connected to
                Rice for as long as I can remember and in several different ways, including long
                ago as a Magisters’ kid and more recently as the mom of two Rice undergrads. Professionally,
                my background is in elementary teaching, but when I moved back to Houston after 11 years
                living outside of London, I decided I was ready for a change, and I’ve loved taking on a
                different role and working with older students at Will Rice.
                <br><br>
                Unlike the rest of the A-Team, I don’t live in the college, so I head home at
                night to any of my four big kids who happen to be around, our aloof cats,
                and a blissfully happy rescue dog. If you were to peek in our windows, you
                might spy us watching a rom-com, playing online trivia, or spontaneously performing
                a show tune in our kitchen. Or we might just be doing the dishes or napping on the
                couch.
                <br><br>
                Over the course of the year, I’m here to help
                and support you in whatever way you need. Whether you’re looking for a
                vacuum cleaner, directions to a professor’s office, or a registration form,
                my office is a good place to start. Probably the most important part of my
                job—and certainly the part I enjoy the most—is providing a place for you
                to sit down, see a friendly face, grab a piece of candy, vent about a test,
                parent, or roommate, or just talk about whatever is going on with you. I’m
                so looking forward to getting to know you!

                Hey Will Rice! We reside in the famous Old Dorm (BEST dorm!) but New Dormers
                – don’t let that stop you from coming by to say hi! We function as a “dream team”
                with Sandy and Will and all of us are here for all of our Will Ricers. We
                are returning for our third year at WRC and this year we have a new addition
                – baby Anderson (affectionately referred to as “Ollie” for his middle name,
                Oliver, by many of our students) joined us in March just in time for his
                first Beer Bike. Our first baby is a yellow lab named Scout who enjoys
                long walks, chasing squirrels, and snacks. Jeremy is the athletic trainer
                for Rice men’s and women’s tennis teams and Chelsea works in the neonatal
                ICU at Texas Children’s Hospital as a speech-language pathologist. Chelsea
                is deeply passionate about wine, binge-worthy Netflix shows, her babies
                (at work and at home), and musical theatre. Jeremy enjoys going to Astros
                games, watching documentaries, and loudly singing to ‘90s music. We can’t
                wait to chat with you by reinstating “Scout’s Office Hours,” host some
                tailgates to share with you one of our most beloved college activities,
                and introduce you to all the festivities Will Rice College has to offer.

            <a href="mailto:Sandra.V.Parsons@rice.edu"><h4>Sandra.V.Parsons@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                Sandy is on the faculty in the
                Department of Psychological Sciences and has been hanging around
                Will Rice as an associate for about 8 years. Sandy loves being an RA
                because she can spend even more time with the students over meals,
                musical performances, athletic events, and whatever else they want to
                do. Sandy has monthly study breaks called “StOp and GrOw” where
                we all hang out and take some time to reflect on what we are doing
                and why. Will is a pediatric oncologist at Texas Children’s Hospital and
                Baylor where he is the Deputy Director of Cancer and Hematology.
                <br><br>
                Sandy and Will love poke bowls, bubble tea, chocolate chip cookies,
                and their two English Bulldogs. They can almost always be found
                walking the dogs in the quad after dinner and will talk endlessly
                about their dogs if you are ever at a loss about how to start a
                conversation with them.
