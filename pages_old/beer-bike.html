        work and is looking forward to a traditional bike race this year (no more Beer Runs please!). Be sure to thank
        them for all the hard work they put in to make our Beer Bike day awesome! Beer Bike 2020 is on April 4. <a

    <h3>Will Rice Bike Team</h3>
    <img src="../resources/images/beer-bike/bike.jpg" width="40%" alt="biker" align="right" style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>When you think about Will Rice, a million great traditions come to mind: Keg in the Quad, lunch time in the
        commons, Long Hall, winning, Activities Council, etc. When you think about Will Rice and Beer Bike, there is
        only one thing to say: SWEEP. Go ahead and say it FIVE times.

        To be a part of the Will Rice Bike Team is special. It sets your heart on fire. When you're basking in the glow
        of the Phoenix, biking into the freezing winds of winter becomes nothing. Tired becomes nothing. Impossibly fast
        becomes nothing. And on the weekend of Beer Bike, when you're standing before all of your friends and your
        college, your family, in the rust and gold jersey you proudly sacrificed your body for, the spirit of
        generations of Will Ricers burns with yours. If the day is just right and you make the dream of a Sweep a
        reality, for a moment you will live like a god. You will never be more proud.

        Clearly, we love this. Other colleges don't understand what it means to love something the way we love the Myth,
        Power, and Value of the Phoenix and Will Rice. We hold just about every cycling record to date and there is no
        end in sight. Will Rice is the most winning college in the history of Beer Bike and we will always give
        ourselves to victory. Alumni, Women, and Men, we are the team that makes it happen.

        If you have any interest in knowing the glory of being part of the bike team, please contact any one of the team
        captains. We all started out with no biking experience and we truly enjoy the thrill of peaceful, casual rides
        too. Sincerely, riding is an experience we would love to share with anyone who is even half-interested.

    <h3>Will Rice Chug Team</h3>
    <img src="../resources/images/beer-bike/chug.jpg" width="40%" alt="chugger" align="left" style="margin-right: 2%">
    <p>Does the whole concept of Beer Bike sound like an amazing experience that you just know that you have to
        participate, but biking maybe isn't your thing? Do you love to stay hydrated, or at the very least get there as
        quickly as possible? Then the Will Rice Chug Team is for you!

        The Chug Team is the another piece of the glorious Beer Bike trifecta, and no less important than the Bikers or
        Pit Crew. The Chuggers start off each race and chug in between each biker, and getting a fast chug can be
        critical in getting Will Rice a good spot around the track and attaining another glorious sweep. Chugging is
        simple, perfecting it is hard. However, some passionate (and probably bored) Rice students have designed simple
        but effective "Chug Cans" with a wide mouth (for a smooth pour) and an air hole that ensures you are getting
        maximum water per second delivered straight to your gullet. The act of chugging is elegantly simple; it has one
        rule and one rule only: Don't spill. Each Chugger has an allowance of one jigger (1.5 ounces) of precious water
        that is allowed to grace their clothes or the ground around them before their chug is ruled a "Wet Chug" and
        their team is penalized five seconds. Beer Bike Sweeps hang in the balance between those five second violations,
        and nobody understands this better than the Chuggers. In order to accomplish this, a Chugger has to be quick,
        precise, calm, passionate, and above all: thirsty. So while our fleet Bikers outpace our foes on the track, our
        stoic Chuggers suck for glory.

        If reading this awakens the spirit of the phoenix within you and all you can think is "When can I start?", look
        no further than the Will Rice Commons. After lunch announcements it isn't uncommon to hear the bellowing
        "CHUUUUUUUUG PRAAAAACTICE!" from captains Kevin and Alicia, signaling aspiring Chuggers and veterans alike that
        their time has come. Even if you are nervous, I wholeheartedly encourage you to come try it once or twice and
        see how you like it. We all started out with no chugging experience and we also enjoy the thrill of peaceful,
        casual chugs too. Chugging is an experience that we would all jump at the chance at being able to share with
        anyone who is even half-interested

    <h3>Will Rice Pit Crew</h3>
    <img src="../resources/images/beer-bike/pitcrew.png" width="40%" alt="pit crew" align="right" style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>The excitement of being on the track on Beer Bike cannot be matched. Right there alongside the Chug and Bike
        Teams stands the Pit Crew. Often overlooked due to its breathtaking efficiency, the Pit Crew is very good at two
        things: slowing bikes down quickly, and speeding bikes up quickly. The faster the pit crew (along with the Chug
        Team) works, the faster the next Biker can be on the track tearing up the competition.

        On the "slowing bikes down" side of things, the Pit employs a Runner and two Catchers. The Runner, who stands at
        the back edge of the pit waving their arms, jumping up and down, and generally making sure the weary bikers make
        it into the right lane. Once the Biker spots them, the Runner runs (surprise!) down the pit and in between the
        Catchers. The Catchers' job is to stop (and preferably catch) the biker so as to avoid a penalty. Catchers work
        in pairs and are preferably good at stopping things without breaking them.

        On flipside of the Pit Crew, we have those responsible for "speeding bikes up". The Pit uses a Flagger and two
        Throwers for this task. The flagger is Chug Team liason, and does not stand in the Pit, but accompanies each
        Chugger to the top of the table tower. They count the Chugger down as the Biker comes into the Pit, and wave
        their flag (read: towel) a carefully calculated amount of time before the Chugger finishes. This signals the
        Throwers to begin their throw. An encyclopedic knowledge of average chug times is a must for the Flagger. The
        Throwers have the task of ejecting the Biker out of the Pit and into the race as fast as possible. They
        coordinate with the Chuggers and Flagger so that, beginning the throw when the flag goes up, they throw the
        Biker across the line just after the Chugger finishes chugging. Being strong-as-hell is a plus.

        The Pit Crew is the grease in the gears of the Will Rice Beer Bike Team. With sure-handed Catchers, swift
        Runners, attentive Flaggers, and burly Throwers, the Pit Crew needs all types to make Will Rice great.
