                Diet is Will Rice's form of student government. The term "Diet" in common use is a bit ambiguous: it can be used to refer to Diet meetings, all of the students who attend those meetings, or just the voting members. Typically Diet meetings are hosted every other week and are open to everyone.
                <br><br>
                Meetings of Diet aren't as formal as the descriptions make them sound and the members of Diet are made up of all kinds of characters from the college. It's true that Diet is the place to engage in lively debates over a new by-law, ask for money to fund a new project idea, or discuss college- or campus-wide policy changes. But Diet is also notorious for planning huge parties, spending on giant inflatable water parks, and even buying the college kegerator.
                <br><br>
                Diet is just as good a distraction from studying as it is an exercise in decision-making. It is always the best place to be informed on the current state of the college and if you have a problem with the way Will Rice does something, you can start the movement to change that here. If you want to be involved, you can find a way at Diet. And if you just want a snack before you go to bed, you know where to go.
                <br><br>
                Diet is our best venue for discussion and information. It is a way for us to practice good policy-making skills and probably the easiest place to start a revolution.
