            If you have an idea for Will Rice that you need money to accomplish there are three ways to obtain funds.
            <br><br>
            The first way is to contact a relevant committee. Check out the committee poster in the commons or the committee members under the Student Leadership section of the website to see who you can talk to.
            <br><br>
            If your idea does not fall under a committee category, or the relevant committee does not have sufficient funds to make it happen there are two options for requesting money: The Diet Fund and the Treasurers Idea Fund.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The Diet Fund has a total of $3000 to be used throughout the year. Most money requests go to the Diet Fund.</li>
                <li>The Treasurer Idea Fund has a total of $200 that is typically used on 1-2 events.</li>
            </ul>

            If your idea is a large-scale event or major purchase, request from the Diet Fund; if your idea is a small-scale event or a minor purchase, request from the Treasurer Idea Fund.
