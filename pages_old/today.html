            As the second oldest college, Will Rice maintains a rich history full of traditions and community. What else would you expect from the College of Gods and Goddesses? Our college, nestled in the more historic side of campus: The Grove, shines like a hidden gem among the other South Colleges. Old Dorm, while lacking an elevator and reliable air conditioning, holds inside of it 100 years’ worth of legends of myth, power, and value. From wall to wall, young phoenixes have left behind imprints and memories of their time at Rice. Across the quad, the more modern New Dorm acts as a symbol of progress, a place that has grown with every new incoming class. Sandwiched between the two dorms is the heart of Will Rice: The Commons. A communal area where you can play a round of ping pong or study for an upcoming exam. Stick around after a meal from Siebel for a quick chat with friends which often turns into hours of conversation. 
            <br><br>
            Our college prides itself on excellence. Hung from the commons ceiling is a tasteful display of our, not four, but five sweeps at Beer Bike. A feat no other college has accomplished. Although this maybe our most famous achievement, especially to the envious outsider, there is so much more to our Will Rice community. Our student government, Diet, allows the voices of all phoenixes to be heard. Want to know how many days until Beer Bike? Forgot when the next RPC public is? Look no further than our daily lunch announcements. When the weekend begins, you can find all your fellow Will Ricers gathered around the picnic tables for Keg In The Quad. Feel free to grab a snack and unwind from the weeks’ worth of hardwork. At night, you can always join in for music and fun in the Kitchen. If you’re ever feeling a little lost fell free to head over the Magister’s home for some guidance.
            <br><br>
            All these things - the traditions, the excitement and the friendships - are what will take you to new heights at Rice. No matter what academic or personal journey you have embarked on, Will Rice Will Support! We have your back every step of the way.
