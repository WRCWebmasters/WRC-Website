			<div class="col-5">
				<p>While growing up in Kansas, Jon thought that he would get a job working in information technology and spend the rest of his life happily sitting alone at a computer. Once he had completed a Computer Science degree from Kansas State University and several years in the IT industry, Jon realized that a future in technology without significant interaction with other people was quickly becoming his own private hell. After a short dalliance with managerial roles (and an MBA from KSU), Jon found the love of his life: teaching. He began a PhD in Organizational Behavior from Michigan State University. During his pre-PhD life, Jon held such varied roles as Comic Book Store Owner, UNIX Systems Administrator, Project Manager, and Statistics Instructor. Despite top-notch training in OB research (and much to the chagrin of his professors), Jon chose to turn away from a research-based life and pursue a career as a teaching-focused professor. He spent three years at the University of Cincinnati, creating, teaching, and managing an undergraduate course on professionalism and ethics before moving on to Rice Business in the summer of 2018. He loves creating interactive classrooms, where students work together with the instructor to teach each other and experience the material directly through personal stories and classroom exercises. </p>

Her first visit to Will Rice resulted in her getting hit in the forehead with a paper airplane, and she knew she had come to the right place. Settling in, she became a Divisional Advisor and dragged her husband, Edward, into the fray as well.  He’s a retired engineer from Exxon Mobil and has volunteered at the Houston Zoo for over 20 years, where he announces sea lion shows and is certified to present the porcupine.  Together they are avid supporters of Will Rice’s artistic and community projects.  They also supply a seven-layer dip for every semester’s Associate Study Break. </p>
