        <h1>On the Daily</h1>
        <h2>Commons Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Will Ricers value our time in the commons together. Eating meals in
          the Commons is our time to catch up and bond casually as a community.
          But even outside of mealtimes, you’ll always find someone studying, or
          more likely procrastinating, in the Commons. Commons is a great place
          to hang out with friends and meet new people. Will Ricers can be found
          conversing, playing board games, and watching movies, sometimes all at
          the same time. The Game Room, just below the Commons, is home to our
          ping-pong table, pool table, foosball tables, and most importantly,
          Smash setup. No matter what you’re looking for, whether good company,
          help with a class, or a vacuum, you can probably find it in Commons.
        </p>

        <h2>Pheaky</h2>
        <p>
          While most residential colleges only have crests, Will Ricers can
          proudly claim to have both a crest and a mascot: our beloved phoenix,
          nicknamed Pheaky. Although a mere surveyor of Will Rice culture might
          mistake the phoenix to serve only as a mythical being, the value (or
          rather, the myth, power, and value) of Pheaky goes far beyond a simple
          symbol.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Greek mythology, when a phoenix would reach the end of its life,
          instead of dying, it would seize up in flames and then be reborn in
          its own ashes. As college students, Will Ricers are continually
          undergoing change. No one of us Will Ricers is perfect, but Pheaky
          reminds us that no matter our mistakes, we grow better with each new
          reincarnation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pheaky’s costume is worn by the Pheaky Representative, a position
          appointed by our President at the start of each term. The Pheaky Rep
          also gets to ride in our Beer Bike float, showcasing the Will Rice
          phoenix spirit! Be sure to keep an eye out for Pheaky in the back of
          commons, where Will Ricers often “sacrifice” items to Pheaky in honor
          of the phoenix spirit.
